### Power Tech Tools

This tools was created as a way of re-enforcing what I learned in my power technician
training with current employer around a year ago or so.  This is also my first attempt
at writing an angular.js based javascript class with [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) to represent the different
variations of solving for WAV [Watts, Amps, Volts] and VAR [ Volts, Amps, Resistance ].
This WebApp also uses the browsers local storage to store a history of your power
calculations in JSON format.  This is a work in progress, if you have any ideas you can
email me, with the project name in the subject and the power related equations and
what you're looking to solve and I'll see what I can do; but my job keep me busy,
so I can't promise anything.
